This is a living document so more information will be added here as we discover it and figure out what the common questions are.

# Config

This is an example of a hackatime config config file.

`.wakatime.cfg`
```cfg
[settings]
api_url = https://waka.hackclub.com/api
api_key = a12b34c5-6d7e-89f0-g1h2-i3j456k78901
```

This file should be placed in your home directory.

- for Linux users this would be `~/.wakatime.cfg` (`/home/yourusername/.wakatime.cfg`) or wherever your home dir is configured to be
- for MacOS users this would be basicaly the same `~/.wakatime.cfg` but with a slightly different absolute path (`/Users/yourusername/.wakatime.cfg`)
- for Windows users simply go to file manager and type in `%USERPROFILE%` and then create a `.wakatime.cfg` file in the folder that appears when you hit enter (absolutely it would be something like `C:\Users\yourusername\.wakatime.cfg`)

If you need additonal help simply ask someone on slack in the #10-hours-in-public channel or dm me (@krn)!
